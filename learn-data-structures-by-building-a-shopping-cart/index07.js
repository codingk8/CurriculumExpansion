  /*
  The easiest way to add an item to our cart is through an item's unique id.
  Because their ids are unique, we can easily identify what kind of items they are.
  Have our `addItem` method take `id` as its first parameter and the `products` array as the second parameter.
  Here's a function that takes two parameters, `name` and `list`:
  ```
  sayName (name, list) {

  }
  ```
  */

  addItem() {

  }
}
